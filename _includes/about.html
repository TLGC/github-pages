                <h2>About TLGC</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2009, the Church has seen spiritual and quantitative growth both in terms of membership maturity and numbers. TLG Churches now exist in 6 areas of the United Kingdom (Aberdeen, Basingstoke, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, and Southampton) and in 3 areas of the Philippines (Sariaya-Quezon, Quezon City and Camiling-Tarlac).</p>
                <p>We are praying for more churches to be planted in areas where the greatest spiritual needs are identified and where the Holy Spirit will lead us to go and make disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
                <p>This is all for the glory of His Mighty Name!</p>

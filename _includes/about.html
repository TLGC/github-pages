                <h2>About TLGC</h2>
                <p>The Living God Church was founded in 2009, the Church has seen spiritual and quantitative growth both in terms of membership maturity and numbers. <a target="_blank" href="http://site.tlg-church.com/church-service/">TLG Churches</a> now exist in 6 areas of the United Kingdom (Aberdeen, Basingstoke, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, and Southampton) and in 3 areas of the Philippines (Sariaya-Quezon, Quezon City and Camiling-Tarlac).</p>
                <p>We are praying for more churches to be planted in areas where the greatest spiritual needs are identified and where the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong> will lead us to go and make disciples of <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>.</p>
                <p>This is all for the glory of His Mighty Name!</p>
